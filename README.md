# dbt-language-server README

The repository contains dbt extension for Visual Studio Code.

## How to build

To build extension locally you need to have `npm` installed.

Run the following commands in the root directory

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run compile
$ code .
```

The above installs all dependencies and opens the project containing both the client and server code.
